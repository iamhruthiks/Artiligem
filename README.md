# Artiligem

Artiligem is a full-stack (MERN) AI web application designed to empower creativity and enhance productivity through the integration of advanced AI technology. Leveraging Googleâ€™s Gemini API, Artiligem delivers a powerful suite of tools specifically tailored for writers, developers, and anyone in need of intelligent content generation.

## Features

- **Authentication:** The application includes user authentication functionality, allowing users to register and log in securely.

- **Authorization:** Access to the tools requires users to be logged in, and certain actions are restricted to ensure that only authorized users can access the tools.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Summary Generator:** Quickly generate concise summaries from lengthy texts, making it easier to grasp essential information.

- **Paragraph Generator:** Produce high-quality, coherent paragraphs from prompts, ideal for content creation and brainstorming.

- **Chatbot:** Engage with our advanced AI chatbot that assists with inquiries, provides inspiration, and supports a variety of tasks.

- **JavaScript Code Generator:** Generate efficient, functional JavaScript code snippets to streamline your development workflow.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Fundamental for structuring web content, providing the backbone for the application.

- **CSS3:** Important for styling and layout, significantly affecting user experience but dependent on HTML structures.

- **JavaScript:** Essential for both front-end and back-end development, powering interactivity and server-side logic.

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building efficient user interfaces with reusable components.

- **Node.js:** Enables server-side scripting with JavaScript, crucial for building scalable applications.

- **Express.js:** Key framework for handling server-side routes, middleware, and APIs effectively.

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** A design pattern that separates the application into three interconnected components, improving organization and scalability. The model handles data, the view is responsible for the UI, and the controller manages user input and interaction.

- **REST APIs:** Standards for enabling communication between web services over HTTP.

- **Gemini API:** The Gemini API key is a unique identifier used to access the Gemini API.

- **Google Analytics 4:** Useful for tracking and analyzing website traffic and user behavior.
