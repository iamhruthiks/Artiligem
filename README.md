# Artiligem

Artiligem is a full-stack (MERN) AI web application designed to empower creativity and enhance productivity through the integration of advanced AI technology. Leveraging Googleâ€™s Gemini API, Artiligem delivers a powerful suite of tools specifically tailored for writers, developers, and anyone in need of intelligent content generation.

## Features

- **Authentication:** The application includes user authentication functionality, allowing users to register and log in securely.

- **Authorization:** Access to the tools requires users to be logged in, and certain actions are restricted to ensure that only authorized users can access the tools.

- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Summary Generator:** Quickly generate concise summaries from lengthy texts, making it easier to grasp essential information.

- **Paragraph Generator:** Produce high-quality, coherent paragraphs from prompts, ideal for content creation and brainstorming.

- **Chatbot:** Engage with our advanced AI chatbot that assists with inquiries, provides inspiration, and supports a variety of tasks.

- **JavaScript Code Generator:** Generate efficient, functional JavaScript code snippets to streamline your development workflow.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Fundamental for structuring web content, providing the backbone for the application.

- **CSS3:** Important for styling and layout, significantly affecting user experience but dependent on HTML structures.

- **JavaScript:** Essential for both front-end and back-end development, powering interactivity and server-side logic.

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building efficient user interfaces with reusable components.
